# MatrixMultiplier
Simple matrix multiplier which can be scaled up to 49x49 square matrix multiplications on the AMD Basys-3 FPGA development board. The ```SimpleMatrixMultiplier```
only implements this matrix multiplier. The ```ReconfigMatMult``` implements the matrix multiplier and adds input A, B binary files and an output file. The ```ReconfigMM2```
does the same but with an updated .xdc file and new project settings.
